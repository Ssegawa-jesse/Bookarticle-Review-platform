#Book/Article Review platform
##Description of the Project
The project is a Book and Article Review Platform developed using HTML and CSS. It is a web-based interface that allows users to read, submit, and explore reviews of books and articles. The platform includes sections for book/article listings, user-submitted reviews, ratings, and possibly categories or genres to help organize content. The main goal is to create a user-friendly, visually appealing website where readers can share their thoughts and help others discover quality reading materials.
##Motivation of the Project

The motivation behind this project stems from the growing need for trusted, community-driven recommendations in the age of information overload. With countless books and articles being published every day, readers often struggle to choose whatâ€™s worth their time. This platform provides a space where users can:

Share honest opinions and reviews.

Discover insightful literature based on peer feedback.

Build a community of readers and learners.
